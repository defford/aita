# AITA Application Debug Logs

## Issue: API and CORS Configuration Problems
Last Updated: 2025-02-22

### Attempted Solutions and Outcomes

#### 1. Initial Setup (Failed)
- **Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error on API endpoints
- **Attempted Fix**: Basic Express.js setup with CORS middleware
- **Outcome**: Failed - CORS preflight requests failing

#### 2. CORS Configuration Update (Failed)
- **Issue**: Preflight requests failing with 500 status
- **Attempted Fix**: 
  - Added explicit CORS headers
  - Configured allowed origins
  - Added OPTIONS request handling
- **Outcome**: Still getting 500 errors on preflight requests

#### 3. Edge Runtime Migration (Failed)
- **Issue**: Function invocation failures in Vercel
- **Changes Made**:
  - Switched to Edge Runtime
  - Updated response format to use Edge Response object
  - Simplified CORS headers
  - Fixed OpenAI import to use named import
  - Added proper OPTIONS handling
- **Outcome**: Failed - "Function Runtimes must have a valid version"

#### 4. Node.js Runtime with Version Specification (Failed)
- **Issue**: Node.js version compatibility
- **Changes Made**:
  - Switched back to Node.js runtime
  - Updated to @vercel/node@3.0.0
  - Added Node.js version specification (18.x)
  - Simplified CORS configuration
  - Updated response format for Node.js
- **Outcome**: Failed - Node.js version errors

#### 5. Remove Runtime Configuration (Failed)
- **Issue**: Function invocation still failing
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed runtime configuration from API files
  - Kept Node.js version in package.json
  - Maintained simplified CORS configuration
  - Kept response format for Node.js
- **Outcome**: Failed - Function invocation errors persist

#### 6. Enhanced Logging and Error Handling (Failed)
- **Issue**: Function invocation failing before any logs
- **Changes Made**:
  - Moved OpenAI initialization outside request handler
  - Added extensive logging throughout code
  - Enhanced error responses with timestamps
  - Improved CORS handling with dynamic origin
- **Outcome**: Failed - FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED (500)
- **Error Details**:
  - Health Check: Immediate 500 error
  - API Endpoint: 500 error on preflight request
  - No logs visible suggesting early initialization failure

### Pattern Analysis
Looking at all attempts, we can observe:
1. The error occurs before any of our code executes (no logs visible)
2. The issue appears to be at the function initialization level
3. All attempts to modify runtime configuration have failed
4. The error is consistent across both endpoints
5. CORS isn't the root issue since we never reach our CORS handling code

### Next Steps to Try
1. Simplify to Minimal API
   - Create a basic endpoint without OpenAI or any dependencies
   - Verify if the function can initialize at all
   - Gradually add complexity back

2. Alternative Deployment Approach
   - Consider Express.js server deployment instead of serverless
   - Try deploying to a different platform (e.g., Heroku)
   - Test locally first to verify the code works

3. Investigate Build Process
   - Check Vercel build logs for any warnings
   - Verify module resolution is working
   - Test with CommonJS instead of ES modules

4. Environment Setup
   - Double-check all environment variables
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Test with different runtime configurations

### Current Hypothesis
The function is failing during the module initialization phase, possibly due to:
1. ES Module compatibility issues
2. OpenAI module resolution problems
3. Environment variable access during cold start
4. Memory constraints during initialization
